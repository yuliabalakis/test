I can't bear you gone
Oh, you're my stars and sun
A force in the room
Of course they're confused, you're stunning
(Just wanna let you know)
When I look back, I just want you back
Don't know how to act
You were cool with that part of me
(You love me naturally)
I'm tired of this feeling, I feel so alone
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
That's how it be
Definitely
Can't stress it, you see, life is a game, that's on me
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
